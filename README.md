📈 Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning  

🔹 Overview  
This project predicts **future sales trends** using **historical data** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.  
Businesses can use this model to make **data-driven decisions** and optimize inventory, marketing, and pricing strategies.  

🔹 How It Works  
✅ We use **past sales data** to train an ML model.  
✅ The model learns patterns and trends in sales.  
✅ It then predicts **future sales** for the next 30 days.  

🔹 Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas (for data processing)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for ML model)  

🔹 Dataset  
We use **synthetic sales data** with daily sales for the last 100 days.  
📌 **Dataset file:** [sales_data.csv](sales_data.csv)  

🔹 Installation & Usage  
1️⃣ Clone this repository: 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Sales-Forecasting.git
cd ML-Sales-Forecasting

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the predictions:
python sales_forecasting.py

🔹 Results:
📊 The model predicts future sales and plots a trend line:

🔹 Business Use Cases
🔹 Retail: Helps stores predict demand and stock accordingly.
🔹 E-commerce: Optimizes pricing and promotions based on trends.
🔹 Manufacturing: Helps in production planning and inventory control.
